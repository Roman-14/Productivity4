# Productivity4

## What is Productivity4?

Productivity4 was an app I made that would tell you what tasks you need to do today, based on attributes you can give to the task, such as a date that the task starts, whether the task should be regularly completed, and if so then how often should it appear? You can also make tasks with a counter such as "Do one hour of studying" 0/3, which uses a + and a - to change the counters progress instead of a checkbox to say done or not done. You can also assign a number of points to each task, which acts as a weight given to each task, so you can prioritise them, as the more points you score, the better your statistics on the chart will look. Also, since it's programmed using Svelte, it allows for immediate update and syncing between devices, so if you check a task as done, it will immediately show up as done on all devices connected to the app without the need for a refresh button.

## When did I make Productivity4?

There were 3 different versions that came before Productivity4 (which were all uncomplete, unlike Productivity4), and it was developed over a long period of time using Svelte and SvelteKit, but it began around June of 2021 and finished development around July 2023.
